# CF 301 Lab 1 - Mobile First

**Author**: Beverly Pham and Steven Starwalt
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We had to style an existing website geared towards mobile-first with a breakpoint at 640px to provide the same user experience on various screen sizes. We also had to add a hamburger menu that displayed upon hover.

## Getting Started
A user must know how to do media queries, understand HTML and CSS.

## Architecture
We used HTML and CSS. We used SMACSS to organize the CSS files. We used IDs and classes to target specific elements.

## Change Log
02/1301028 2:00pm - Application has functioning hamburger navigation menu that displays on hover. Application navigation menu also changes display when viewed on desktop instead of mobile.

## Credits and Collaborations
We used Stack Overflow to research features and properties we were not sure how to use. We learned about clear fix at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/. IcoMoon icon fonts were provided to us. Kat (our TA) and Allie (our instructor) also helped us.
